Upload additional supplementary files:
=============

You may also upload additional supplementary files (non-raw files), such as processed outputs from your own data analysis pipeline, SOPs, clinical data, etc. You can select the appropriate data category for the files you wish upload - ‘Alternative Processing Pipeline’, ‘Other Metadata’ and ‘Supplementary Data’.

Once you complete the Study creation, you may proceed to upload the supplementary files associated with the study. We recommend you contact the PDC team to validate your study on Workspace before you begin uploading the non-raw files.

To begin uploading any of these types of files, select “Direct Upload” under the ‘Non-Raw Files’ tab in the ‘Upload’ dropdown.

In the upload interface, first you must select the study you wish to associate the files with, and the type of file. 
You may choose to directly select a study, and the ‘Program’ and ‘Project’ options will be automatically filled.

The Data Source ‘Submitter’ will be automatically filled in. The other option, CDAP, is used by the PDC team to handle the upload of files produced by the “Common Data Analysis Pipeline.” 
Choose the data category you wish to upload from the ‘Data Category’ dropdown. Note that you will only be able to upload files with extensions belonging to that category. You may choose to upload a directory of files simultaneously, and file extensions that do not match the selected category will be automatically removed. However, note that some data categories have overlapping file extensions. You may wish to organize your files by data category prior to uploading.

This completes the process of submission of a dataset for release through the PDC data portal. If you have any questions about this process, please contact the PDC by email for help PDCHelpDesk@mail.nih.gov.
