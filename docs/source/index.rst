PDC Workspace Data Submission Overview
===================================

PDC Data Submission and Release policies:
--------------

PDC adheres to NIH data sharing policy, emphasizing prompt accessibility of shared scientific data, ideally concurrent with an associated publication or by the end of the award/support period, whichever comes first. Even for programs not funded by NIH, PDC strongly recommends releasing data no later than the associated publication's time. PDC has no embargo policy; once data is released, it becomes freely accessible to the public, aligning with PDC's CC-BY license policy.

Regarding the release process:
--------------

To ensure HIPAA compliance, PDC does not collect protected health information (PHI), and data submitters must ensure data have been de-identified before submission.
Data submission can occur up to a year before release, but processing begins upon the author's request for prioritized release.
Processing takes approximately six to eight weeks, contingent on complete upload and validation as per PDC's submission requirements.
Authors are advised to plan early, considering potential delays in data and metadata gathering, and PDC processing timelines.
Data is released upon author request, either concurrent with publication or on a specified date. Once a release is requested, the dataset will be added to the closest scheduled release, but we make every effort to release as close as possible to the date requested. Data will normally be available on the PDC portal after business hours on the release date. Authors are advised to inform PDC well in advance, ideally as soon as their publication is accepted, to facilitate a timely and seamless release process.
Citation details may be added post-release, with authors responsible for notifying PDC.
Post-release revisions follow the PDC versioning process. Refer to the FAQ on 'What is a study version?'
PDC provides links to other established repositories if there is corresponding complementary multiomic data such as genomics or imaging data available for a cohort. Authors are encouraged to provide the mapping information either through the PDC submission template or separately. The mapping can be both at the case or patient level and also at the study level.
When including PDC study identifiers in journal data availability statements, please cite the PDC resource using the URL https://pdc.cancer.gov along with the relevant study identifiers (e.g., PDC000250). Alternatively, you can cite the study URL directly (e.g., https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/study/PDC000250).
